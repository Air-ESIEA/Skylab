Gitea is the git server
Setting for Gitea are located in /etc/gitea/app.ini
Data files should be located under /var/lib/gitea

Gitea use its own user gitea
The admin account that can be used in the web interface is root, with the password of the root account at time of writing

Logs files can be accessed at /var/log/gitea/
There is 3 logs files :
	- gitea.log for the gitea website actual working
	- xorm.log for the database logs
	- http.log for the webserver

Normally, http.log should be empty, as Apache Web Server is used as a proxy, gitea relies on it to serve http pages

Gitea was originally deployed using PostgreSQL, so there could be some remnants here and there.
It is now using MariaDB, under its own user gitea, with the gitea database
If the database have to be replaced, beware of charset compatibility and refer to the Archlinux Wiki page on gitea

At time of writing, repos are located under /var/lib/gitea/repos/ but it is intended to put them under /storage/gitea/repos
