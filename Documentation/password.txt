Did you really thought you would find password on a public git repo ? :P

Password management for Skylab is done using pass and GnuPG with the root account.
The gpg key used in the encryption is specific to the Association

files are located under /root/.password-store

Any change made to password should be made accordingly into the password store
At time of writing, the key has a validity of 6 month, set to expire in july 2019

password store should also be sync into gitea with the root account to ensure backup and accessibility
if you lost the master password PGP, start praying :D
