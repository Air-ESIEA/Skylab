The mail server is the combinaison of Postfix for transfert and dovecot for delivery
Conf files:
Postfix:
	conf files are located at /etc/postfix/
	the main file is main.cf
Dovecot:
	conf files is located at /etc/dovecot/dovecot.conf

Log files:
Postfix:
	Logs can be accessed by using 
	# journalctl -u postfix.service
Dovecot:
	logs can be acessed bu using
	# journalctl -u dovecot.service

Further information on configuration can be found directly in the conf files comments
Internet is also a good source. Check the Archlinux wiki, and the project's webpages
In any case, should you alter conf files, good luck, for Postfix/Dovecot is a pain in the arse
