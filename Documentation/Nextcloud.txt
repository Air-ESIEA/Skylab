Nextcloud is a webapp service served by the Apache web server

Conf files are located under /etc/webapps/nextcloud
Data files for the web pages are located under /var/lib/webapps/nextcloud/
# TO CHECK
log files should be located under Apaches logs at /var/log/httpd
Files uploaded to nextcloud should be stored under /storage/nextcloud/

Nextcloud used mariaDB databases under its own user nextcloud with its own database nextcloud

Beware of updates of either php or nextcloud package, as they can break the nextcloud webapp
In any cases, should you upgrade the system, remember to disable 3rd party apps before commiting the updates, as instructed in The Archlinux wiki pages
The wiki is quite extensive, and you should find answers on question you have in it
